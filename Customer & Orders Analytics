#In this SQL below, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in order to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales; 

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'; 

3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB0.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB0.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID;

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
